Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []

// Source Code

class Codec {
 public:
  // Encodes a tree to a single string.
  string serialize(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
      return "";

    string s;
    queue<TreeNode*> q{{root}};

    while (!q.empty()) {
      TreeNode* node = q.front();
      q.pop();
      if (node != nullptr) {
        s += to_string(node->val) + " ";
        q.push(node->left);
        q.push(node->right);
      } else {
        s += "n ";
      }
    }

    return s;
  }

  // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
  TreeNode* deserialize(string data) {
    if (data.empty())
      return nullptr;

    istringstream iss(data);
    string word;
    iss >> word;
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(stoi(word));
    queue<TreeNode*> q{{root}};

    while (iss >> word) {
      TreeNode* node = q.front();
      q.pop();
      if (word != "n") {
        node->left = new TreeNode(stoi(word));
        q.push(node->left);
      }
      iss >> word;
      if (word != "n") {
        node->right = new TreeNode(stoi(word));
        q.push(node->right);
      }
    }

    return root;
  }
};
