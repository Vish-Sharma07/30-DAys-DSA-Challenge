Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]

// Source Code

class Solution {
 public:
  ListNode* reverseKGroup(ListNode* head, int k) {
    if (head == nullptr)
      return nullptr;

    ListNode* tail = head;

    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
      // There are less than k nodes in the list, do nothing.
      if (tail == nullptr)
        return head;
      tail = tail->next;
    }

    ListNode* newHead = reverse(head, tail);
    head->next = reverseKGroup(tail, k);
    return newHead;
  }

 private:
  // Reverses [head, tail).
  ListNode* reverse(ListNode* head, ListNode* tail) {
    ListNode* prev = nullptr;
    ListNode* curr = head;
    while (curr != tail) {
      ListNode* next = curr->next;
      curr->next = prev;
      prev = curr;
      curr = next;
    }
    return prev;
  }
};
